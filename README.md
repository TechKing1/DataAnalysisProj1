# Data Analysis - Project 1

This was my first project in my Data Analysis course during my time pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. With this project, I studied whether or not sleep had any effect with students' GPAs, and whether or not sacrificng sleep in order to study/work was really worth it in the long run.
